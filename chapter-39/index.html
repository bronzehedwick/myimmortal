      <aside>
        <p>Disclaimer: I do not own the <abbr title="Harry Potter">HP</abbr> series and I am not the real XXXbloodyrists666XXX.</p>
        <p><abbr title="Author’s note">AN</abbr>// I am an extremely immature pathetic idiot girl, I know. Out of boredom, I crack this girl’s passy for fun (and it took less than 8 minutes to do it too) and will probably get in a shitload of trouble. Which I probably deserve ’cause I’m being a troll right now. Meh.</p>
        <p>And I present to you MY crappy part in this story. (And take note I haven’t even finished reading this fic yet, but instead skip over to skim chapter 38.) Flame, laugh, do whatever you want ‟preps.”</p>
      </aside>
      <p>I, the American retail wearing british vampire Sue, coughed up blood.</p>
      <p>Satan kneeled down beside me.</p>
      <p>‟Noooooooooooooooo! Don’t die!”</p>
      <p>I gave him a rueful smile. ‟I’m sorry. It’s something I had to do, to fufill my duty as the noble gothic Mary Sue.”</p>
      <p>Satan sobbed. ‟I love you Ebony.”</p>
      <p>‟I love you two. I’ll...I’ll see you in hell.” I mumbled, already finding my surroundings fading to black.</p>
      <p>B’loody Mary Smith suddenly popped into the room for no apparent reason. She frowned when she realized the room was oddly quiet, but at the sight of Ebony’s lifeless body, she screamed. Her face became pale with horror. She screamed for the healers, Dumbledore, Mcgoogle, and every single gothic person she could think of.</p>
      <p>Suddenly, a glow started to surround the body of Ebony. Everyone stared in shock. Her body started to lift ever so slowly and then, to everyone’s shock, it started to incinerate.</p>
      <p>When everyone realized what was happening, they rushed over to try to rescue the body, but it was too late, the Sue became nothing more then a pile of ashes.</p>
      <p>A loud resounding of everyone bellowing ‟NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO...!!” filled the room.</p>
      <p>A flash of white light from the ashes then started to bounce around the room. Everyone cowered in fear and were temporarily blinded. When it was all over, things changed.</p>
      <p>All the silly goth clothes dropped from everyone’s bodies <span role="note">(<abbr title="Author's note">AN</abbr>//I will refuse to explain how the hell that happened.)</span> and, in their place, clothes the characters would normally wear in canon appeared on their bodies.</p>
      <p>When everyone got over the shock of becoming free of the gofick power, everybody cheered. Everyone started singing ‛Ding dong the sue is dead...’ Well, that is, until all the <abbr title=‟Harry Potter”>HP</abbr> characters realized the true implications of becoming more canon like again.</p>
      <p>All the characters who were supposed to be dead fell to the floor, their bodies cold and lifeless. Harry and Voldemort started dueling. On the left side of the two, the battle of the Light Side and the Dark Side were reaching a climax.</p>
      <p>And, because the replacement author also likes to screw around with canon, Draco and Hermione fled the scene and got married.</p>
      <hr>
      <p>Meanwhile...</p>
      <p>Down in hell, Ebony shed a single tear because of her current situation. A situation that would live on for all eternity. Or at least until the end of fanfiction time.</p>
      <p>She lost it all, but she knew she had to remain strong. Nothing would ever break her down.</p>
      <p>She looked down over her pale body, and frowned. ‛Where are my emo clothes?’ She asked herself in confusion.</p>
      <p>And then it occured to her...</p>
      <p>For her shirt, she was wearing a bright pink polo with a little seagull on the <span role="note">(right or left? I can’t remember)</span> side. Below that, she was wearing a denim miniskirt with the ‟destroyed” look on it. Paired underneath that skirt were leggings with a little moose at the bottom. And then Ebony realized, on her shoulder, she was carrying a pretty bag with an eagle on it that said Live Your Life written all over the bag.</p>
      <p>Ebony supressed the urge to scream. Here she was decked out in clothes prep to the extreme wearing stuff from Abercrombie and Fitch, American Eagle, AND Hollister.</p>
      <p>Panicked, Ebony hastily tried to take off the Hollister polo, but underneath it, there was another Hollister polo underneath. Ebony frowned, and looked under her shirt. All she saw was a bra underneath <span role=‟note”>(dare I point out it’s from the Aerie line available at American Eagle?)</span>. Ebony tried to remove the shirt again. But to her frustration, there was yet again another polo to replace it.</p>
      <p>‟THIS IS UNLOGICAL AND DOES NOT MAKE ANY SENSE!!” Ebony bellowed out to the air. She failed to see the irony in her statement, how hypocrytical her words were, seeing as she was practically calling the kettle black here.</p>
      <p>Ebony slit her writs and mumbled to herself, ‟Omigod.”</p>
      <p>/End Crap Fic.</p>
