        <p>Obviously I did not write this, it was published on this site 5 years ago, then removed. There are probably other copies of this on FanFiction as well as other sites, but I though I’d post it anyway. Those who remember <em>My Immortal</em> well should also remember the first few chapters (1-15) were co-written with ‛Raven’ hence they were spelt better etc but don’t worry Raven leaves in chapter 16 (which is where her character Willow gets expelled from Hogwarts). However, she seems to return…The copy on here I’m pretty sure is the 100% original version of <em>My Immortal</em> with no edits at all outside those by Raven (which were in the original).</p>
        <p>This version will include the ‛hacker’ chapter 39 and the original chapter 39, and the possibly fake ‟<em>My Immortal</em> 2” if I can find it! I will also include links to the <em>My Immortal</em> ‟<em><strong>MOVIE</strong></em>” and other sites where you can read more at the end.</p>
        <p>Thank—or ‟<em>Fangz</em>”—You!</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p><em>My Immortal</em> is the most famous, notoriously bad fan fiction ever written. Based <em>very</em> loosely in the <em>Harry Potter</em> universe and featuring the blatant <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Sue">Mary-Sue</a> protagonist Ebony (or often times ‟Enoby”) Dark’ness Dementia Raven Way, it reads like a detailed list of everything a fanfic author could ever possibly do wrong, only taken to exaggerated, horrifying extremes. Written by super-tard Tara Gilesbie, <em>My Immortal</em> was originally posted to sometime in 2006, but was subsequently deleted by the staff after causing a severe drop in the site’s collective IQ. In fact, the fanfic is so unbelievably bad that many refuse to accept that it’s real, insisting that Tara was only trolling and that the story is really a parody. Regardless of the author’s intent, <em><em>My Immortal</em></em> remains one of the most cringe-worthy, unintentionally hilarious, so-bad-it’s-good pieces of literature the internets have ever shat out.</p>
