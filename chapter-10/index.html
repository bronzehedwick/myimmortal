        <p>I was really scared about Vlodemort all day. I was even upset went to rehearsals with my gothic metal band Bloody Gothic Rose 666. I am the lead singer of it and I play guitar. People say that we sound like a cross between GC, Slipknot and <abbr title="My Chemical Romance">MCR</abbr>. The other people in the band are B’loody Mary, Vampire, Draco, Ron <span role="note">(although we call him Diabolo now. He has black hair now with blue streaks in it.)</span> and Hargrid. Only today Draco and Vampire were depressed so they weren’t coming and we wrote songs instead. I knew Draco was probably slitting his wrists (he wouldn’t die because he was a vampire too and the only way you can kill a vampire is with a c-r-o-s-s (there’s no way I’m writing that) or a steak) and Vampire was probably watching a depressing movie like The Corpse Bride. I put on a black leather shirt that showed off my boobs and tiny matching miniskirt that said Simple Plan on the butt. You might think I’m a slut but I’m really not.</p>
        <p>We were singing a cover of ‘Helena’ and at the end of the song I suddenly bust into tears.</p>
        <p>“Ebony! Are you OK?” B’loody Mary asked in a concerted voice.</p>
        <p>“What the fuck do you think?” I asked angrily. And then I said. “Well, Voldemort came and the fucking bastard told me to fucking kill Harry! But I don’t want to kill him, because, he’s really nice, even if he did go out with Draco. But if I don’t kill Harry, then Voldemort, will fucking kill Draco!” I burst into tears.</p>
        <p>Suddenly Draco jumped out from behind a wall.</p>
        <p>“Why didn’t you fucking tell me!” he shouted. “How could you- you- you fucking poser muggle bitch!” <span role="note">(c is dat out of character?)</span></p>
        <p>I started to cry and cry. Draco started to cry too all sensitive. Then he ran out crying.</p>
        <p>We practiced for one more hour. Then suddenly Dumbeldore walked in angrily! His eyes were all fiery and I knew this time it wasn’t cause he had a headache.</p>
        <p>“What have you done!” He started to cry wisely. <span role="note">(c dats basically nut swering and dis time he wuz relly upset n u wil c y)</span> “Ebony Draco has been found in his room. He committed suicide by slitting his wrists.”</p>
