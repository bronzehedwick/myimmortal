        <p>‟DRACO!” I shouted. "What the fuck do you think you are doing?"</p>
        <p>Draco didn’t answer but he stopped the flying car and he walked out of it. I walked out of it too, curiously.</p>
        <p>‟What the fucking hell?” I asked angrily.</p>
        <p>‟Ebony?” he asked.</p>
        <p>‟What?” I snapped.</p>
        <p>Draco leaned in extra-close and I looked into his gothic red eyes (he was wearing color contacts) which revealed so much depressing sorrow and evilness and then suddenly I didn’t feel mad anymore.</p>
        <p>And then…………… suddenly just as I Draco kissed me passionately. Draco climbed on top of me and we started to make out keenly against a tree. He took of my top and I took of his clothes. I even took of my bra. Then he put his thingie into my you-know-what and we did it for the first time.</p>
        <p>‟Oh! Oh! Oh! ” I screamed. I was beginning to get an orgasm. We started to kiss everywhere and my pale body became all warm. And then….</p>
        <p>‟WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING YOU MOTHERFUKERS!”</p>
        <p>It was…………………………………………………….Dumbledore!</p>
