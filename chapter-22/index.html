        <p>All day everyone talked about the Misery of Magic. Well anyway, I woke up the next day. I was in my coffin so I opened the door. I was wearing blak lacey leather pajamas. Then I gasped.</p>
        <p>Standing in front of me where………………. B;loody Mary, Vampire, Diabolo, Draco, Dracula and Willow! I opened my crimson eyes. Willow was wearing a tight black leather top with pictures of bloody roses all over it. Under that she wart a black poofy skirt wit lace on it and black gothic boots that was attached to the top. Vampire was wearing a baggy Simple Plan t-shirt and baggy black pants and Vans. Draco was wearing a black <abbr title="My Chemical Romance">MCR</abbr> t-shirt and blak jeans and a leather jacket. He looked just likee Gerard Way, and almost as fucking sexy. Vampire looked like Joel Madden. B’loody Mary was wearing a tight black poofy gothic dress that she had ripped so it showed of all her clearage with a white apron that said ‘bich’ and other swear words and <abbr title="My Chemical Romance">MCR</abbr> lyrics on it kind of like one dress I had seen Amy Lee wear once. Darkness <span role="note">(who is Jenny)</span> was there too. She was weaving a ripped gothic black dress with ripped stuff all over it and a lace-up top thing and black pointy boots. So were Crab and Goyle. It turns out that Darkness, Diabolo, Crab and Goyle’s dad was a vampire. He committed suicide by slitting his wrists with a razor. He had raped them and stuff before too. They all got so depressed that they became goffik and converted to Stanism.“<abbr title="Oh my fucking God">OMFG</abbr>” I yielded as I jumped up. “Why the fuck are u all here?”</p>
        <p>“Enoby something is really fucked up.” Draco said.</p>
        <p>“OK but I need to put my fucking clothes on first.” I shouted angrily.</p>
        <p>“It’s all right. We have to go now and you look <span lang="ja">kawaii</span> anyway. Your so fucking beautiful.” Draco said in a sexy voice.</p>
        <p>“Oh all right.” I said smiling. “But you have to tell me why your being all erective.”</p>
        <p>“I will I will.” he said.</p>
        <p>So I just put on some black eyeliner, black lipstick and red eyeshadow and white foundation. Then I came. We all went outside the Great Hal and looked in from a widow. A fucking prep called Britney from Griffindoor was standing next to us. She was wearing a pink mini and a Hilary Duff t-shirt so we put up our middle fingers at her. Inside the Great Hall we could see Dumbledork. Cornelia Fudged was there shouting at Dumbledore. Doris Rumbridge was there too.</p>
        <p>“THIS CANNOT BE!” she shouted angrily. “THE SCHOOL MUST BE CLOSED!”</p>
        <p>“THE BARK LORD IS PLANNING TO KILL THE STUDENTS!” yelled Cornelia Fudge.</p>
        <p>“YOU ARE NOT FIT TO BE THE PRINCIPAL ANY LONGER!” yelled Rumbridge. “YOU ARE TOO OLD AND YOUR ALZHEIMERS IS DANGEROUS! YOU MUST RETRY OR VOLDEMORT WILL KILL YOUR STUDENTS!”</p>
        <p>“Very well.” Dumbledore said angrily. “Butt we cannot do this. We can’t close the school. There is only one person who is capable of killing Voldemort and she is in the school. And her name is…………………………………………………………………..Enony Dark’ness Dementia Raven Way.”</p>
        <p>Draco, Crab, Goyle, Darkness, Willow, Vampire and B’loody Mary looked at each other………I gasped.</p>
