        <p>I was so mad and sad. I couldn’t believe Draco for cheating on me. I began to cry against the tree where I did it with Draco.</p>
        <p>Then all of a suddenly, an horrible man with red eyes and no nose and everything started flying towards me on a broomstick! He didn’t have a nose <span role="note">(basically like Voldemort in the movie)</span> and he was wearing all black but it was obvious he wasn’t gothic. It was…… Voldemort!</p>
        <p>“No!” I shouted in a scared voice but then Voldemort shouted “Imperius!” and I couldn’t run away.</p>
        <p>“Crookshanks!” I shouted at him. Voldemort fell of his broom and started to scream. I felt bad for him even though I’m a sadist so I stopped.</p>
        <p>“Ebony.” he yelled. “Thou must kill Vampire Potter!”</p>
        <p>I thought about Vampire and his sexah eyes and his gothic black hair and how his face looks just like Joel Madden. I remembered that Draco had said I didn’t understand, so I thought, what if Draco went out with Vampire before I went out with him and they broke up?</p>
        <p>“No, Voldemort!” I shouted back.</p>
        <p>Voldemort gave me a gun. “No! Please!” I begged.</p>
        <p>“Thou must!” he yelled. “If thou does not, then I shall kill thy beloved Draco!”</p>
        <p>“How did you know?” I asked in a surprised way.</p>
        <p>Voldemort got a dude-ur-so-retarded look on his face. “I hath telekinesis.” he answered cruelly. “And if you doth not kill Vampire, then thou know what will happen to Draco!” he shouted. Then he flew away angrily on his broomstick.</p>
        <p>I was so scared and mad I didn’t know what to do. Suddenly Draco came into the woods.</p>
        <p>“Draco!” I said. “Hi!”</p>
        <p>“Hi.” he said back but his face was all sad. He was wearing white foundation and messy eyeliner kind of like a pentagram <span role="note">(geddit)</span> between Joel Madden and Gerard Way.</p>
        <p>“Are you okay?” I asked.</p>
        <p>“No.” he answered.</p>
        <p>“I’m sorry I got all mad at you but I thought you cheated on me.” I expelled.</p>
        <p>“That’s okay.” he said all depressed and we went back into Hogwarts together making out. </p>
