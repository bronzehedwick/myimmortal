        <p>We ran happily to Hogsmede. There we saw the stage where <abbr title="Good Charlotte">GC</abbr> had played. We ran in happly. <abbr title="My Chemical Romance">MCR</abbr> were there playing ‘Helena’. I was so fucking happy! Gerard looked even sexier than he did in da pictures. Even Draco thought so, I could totally see him getting an erection but it didn’t matter cuz I knew know that we were da only true ones for eachother. I was wearing a black leather minidress and black leather platinum boots with red ripped fishnets. Draco was wearing a black baggy <abbr title="My Chemical Romance">MCR</abbr> t-shirt and black baggy pants. Anyway, we stated moshing to Helena. We frenched. We ran up 2 the front of the band to stage-dive. Suddenly, Gerard pulled off his mask. So did the others. We gasped. It wasn’t them at all. It was.,……………………….. Volsemort and da Death Dealers!</p>
        <p>“Wtf Draco im not going to a concert wid u!” I shouted angrily. “Not after what happened to me last time? Even if its <abbr title="My Chemical Romance">MCR</abbr> n u no how much I lik them”</p>
        <p>“What cause we…you know…” he gadgetted uncomfortbli cause guys don’t like to talk a bout you-know-what.</p>
        <p>“Yeah cause we you know!” I yielded in an angry voice.</p>
        <p>“We won’t do that again.” Draco promised. “This time, we’re going with an ESCORT.”</p>
        <p>“<abbr title="Oh my fucking God">OMFG</abbr> wtf/ Are you giving into the mainstream?” I asked. “So I guess ur a prep or a Christina or what now?”</p>
        <p>“NO.” he muttered loudly.</p>
        <p>“R u becoming a prep or what?” I shootd angrily.</p>
        <p>“Enoby! I’m not! Pls come with me!” He fell down to his knees and started singing ‘Da world is black’ by <abbr title="Good Charlotte">GC</abbr> to me.</p>
        <p>I was flattened cause that’s not even a single, he had memorized da lyrks just 4 me!</p>
        <p>“OK then I guess I will have to.” I said and then we frenched 4 a while and I went up 2 my room.</p>
        <p>B’loody Mary was standing there. “Hajimemashite gurl.” she said happily <span role="note">(she spex Japanese so do i. dat menz ‘how do u do’ in japanese)</span>. “<abbr title="By the way">BTW</abbr> Willow that fucking poser got expuld. she failed al her klasses and she skepped math.” <span role="note">(<abbr title="Author's note">an</abbr>: RAVEN U FUKIN SUK!

        <p>“It serves that fuking bich right.” I laughed angrily.</p>
        <p>Well anyway we where felling all deprezzed. We wutsched some goffic movies like Das niteMARE b4 xmas. “Maybe Willow will die too.” I said.</p>
        <p>“Kawai.” B’loody Mair shook her head enrgtically lethrigcly. “Oh yeah o have a confession after she got expuld I murdered her and den loopin did it with her cause he’s a necphilak.”</p>
        <p>“Kawai.” I commnted happily . We talked to each other in silence for da rest uv da movie.</p>
        <p>“OH HEY <abbr title="By the way">BTw</abbr>, im going to a concert with drako tonight in Hogsmeade with mcr.” I sed. “ I need to wear like da hotset outfit EVA.”</p>
        <p>B’Loody Mairy Nodded ENREGeticALLlY. “Omfg totally lets go shopping.”</p>
        <p>“In Hot Topic, right?” I asked, already getting out my spshcial Hot Topic Loiyalty carde.</p>
        <p>“No.” My head snaped up.</p>
        <p>‘WHAT?” my head spuin. I could not believe it. “B’Loody Mary are u a PREP?”</p>
        <p>“NOOOO!NOOOO!” She laughed. “I found some cool goffic stores near Hogwarts that’s all.”</p>
        <p>“Hu told u abut them” I askd sure it would be Drako or Diabolo or Vampire<span role="note">(don’t even SAY that nam to me!)</span>. Or me.</p>
        <p>“Dumblydore.” She sed. “Let me just call our broms.”</p>

        <p>“Yah I saw the map for Hogsmeade on his desk.” She told me. “Come on let’s go.”</p>
        <p>We were going in a few punkgoff stores SPECIALLY for the concerts in Hogsmeade. The salesperson was <abbr title="Oh my God">OMG</abbr> HOTTER THAN GERARD EXCEPT NOT CAUSE THAT’S IMPOSSIBLE and he gave me a few dresses. “We only have these for da real goffs.”</p>

        <p>“Yah u wouldn’t believe how many posers ther are in this town man! Yesterday loopin and snap tried to buy a goffic camera pouch.” He shook his head. “I dint even no they had a camera.”</p>
        <p>“<abbr title="Oh my fucking God">OMFG</abbr> NO THEIR GONNA SPY ON ME AGAIN!” I cried, running out of the changing room wearing a long black dress with lots of red tulle coming out and very low-cut with a huge slit.</p>
        <p>“Oh my satan you have to buy that outfit” The salesperson said.</p>
        <p>“Yeah it looks totlly hot.” said B’Loody Mary.</p>
        <p>“You know what I am gona give it to you free cause u look really hot in that utfit. Hey are you gonna be at the concert tonight?” he asked.</p>
        <p>“Yeah I am actually.” I looked back at him. “Hey <abbr title="By the way">BTW</abbr> my name’s ebondy dark’ness dementia TARA way what’s yours?”</p>
        <p>“Tom Rid.” He said and ran a hand through his black-dyed hair. “maybe I’ll see you there tonight.”</p>
        <p>“Yeah I don’t think so cause I am going there with my bf drako you sick perv!” I yelled angrily, but before he could beg me to go with him, Hargrid flew in on his black broom looking worried. “<abbr title="Oh my fucking God">OMFG</abbr> EBONDY U NEED OT GET BACK INTO THE CASTLE NOW!”</p>
