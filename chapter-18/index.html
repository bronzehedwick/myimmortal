        <p>I woke up the next day in my coffin. I walked out of it and put on some black eyeliner, black eyesharrow, blood-bed lipstick and a black really low-cut leather dress that was all ripped and in stripes so you could see my belly. I was wearing a skull belly ring with black and red diamonds inside it.</p>
        <p>(Da night before Draco and I rent back to the skull <span role="note">(geddit skull koz im goffik n I like deth)</span>. Dumbeldore chased Vlodemort away. We flew there on our brooms. Mine was black and the broom-stuff was blood-red. There was lace all over it. Draco had a black <abbr title="My Chemical Romance">MCR</abbr> boom. We went back to our rooms and we had you-know-what to a Linkin Park song.)</p>
        <p>Well anyway I went down to the Grate Hall. There all da walls were painted black and da tables were black too. But you fould see that there was pink pant underneath the black pant. And there were pastors of poser bands everywhere, like Ashlee Simpson and the Backstreet Boys.</p>
        <p>“<abbr title="What the fuck">WTF</abbr>!” I shouted going to sit next to B’loody Mary and Willow. B’loody Mary was wearing a black leather mini with a Good Chraloote t-shirt, black fishnets and black pointy boots. Willow was wearing a long gothic blak dress with blood red writing that was all lacy and came up to your thighs and black boots and fishnets. Vampire, Dracula and Draco came. We started to talk about who was sexier, Mikey or Gerard Way or Billie Joe Armstrong. The boys joined in cause they were bi.</p>
        <p>“Those guys are so fucking hot.” Navel was saying as suddenly a gothic old man with a black beard and everything came. He was the same one who had chassed away Vlodemort yesterday. He had normal tan skin but he was wearing white foundation and he had died his hare black.</p>
        <p>“……………….DUMBLEDORE?1!” we all gasped.</p>
        <p>“<abbr title="What the fuck">WTF</abbr>?” I shouted angrily. “I thought he was just wearing that to scare Volsemort!”</p>
        <p>“Hello everyone.” he said happily. “As u can see I gave the room a makeover. Whjat do u fink about it?”</p>
        <p>Everyone from the poser table in Gryiffindoor started to cheer. Well we goths just looked at each other all disfusted and shook our heads. We couldn’t believe what a poser he was!1.</p>
        <p>“<abbr title="By the way">BTW</abbr> you can call me Albert.” HE CALLED AS WE LEFT to our classes.</p>
        <p>“What a fucking poser!” Draco shouted angrily as we we to Transfomation. We were holding hands. Vampire looked really jealous. I could see him crying blood in a gothic way <span role="note">(geddit, way lik Gerard)</span> but I didn’t say anything. “I bet he’s havin a mid-life crisis!” Willow shouted.</p>
        <p>I was so fucking angry.</p>
