        <p>Hi my name is Ebony Dark’ness Dementia Raven Way and I have long ebony black hair (that’s how I got my name) with purple streaks and red tips that reaches my mid-back and icy blue eyes like limpid tears and a lot of people tell me I look like Amy Lee <span role="note">(<abbr title="Author's note">AN</abbr>: if u don’t know who she is get da hell out of here!)</span>. I’m not related to Gerard Way but I wish I was because he’s a major fucking hottie. I’m a vampire but my teeth are straight and white. I have pale white skin. I’m also a witch, and I go to a magic school called Hogwarts in England where I’m in the seventh year (I’m seventeen). I’m a goth (in case you couldn’t tell) and I wear mostly black. I love Hot Topic and I buy all my clothes from there. For example today I was wearing a black corset with matching lace around it and a black leather miniskirt, pink fishnets and black combat boots. I was wearing black lipstick, white foundation, black eyeliner and red eye shadow. I was walking outside Hogwarts. It was snowing and raining so there was no sun, which I was very happy about. A lot of preps stared at me. I put up my middle finger at them.</p>
        <p>‟Hey Ebony!” shouted a voice. I looked up. It was.... Draco Malfoy!</p>
        <p>‟What’s up Draco?” I asked.</p>
        <p>‟Nothing.” he said shyly.</p>
        <p>But then, I heard my friends call me and I had to go away.</p>
