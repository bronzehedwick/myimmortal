        <p>The door opened and Proffesor Rumbridge and Cornelia Fudge stomped out angrily. Then Dumbledum and Rumbridge sawed us.</p>
        <p>“MR. WAY WHAT THE BEEP ARE YOU DOING!” Rumbridge shouted angrily. Dumbledore blared at her.</p>
        <p>“Oops she made a mistake!” he corrupted her. “She means hi everybody cum in!”</p>
        <p>Well we all came in angrily. So did all the other students. I sat between Darkness and Draco and opposite B’loody Mary. Crab and Goyle started 2 make some morbid jokes. They both looked exactly like Ville Vollo. I eight some Count Chocula and drank som blood from a cup. Then I herd someone shooting angrily. I looked behind me it was………Vampire! He and Draco were shooting at eachother.</p>
        <p>“Vampire, Draco <abbr title="What the fuck">WTF</abbr>?” I asked.</p>
        <p>“You fucking bustard!” yelled Draco at Vampire. “I want to shit next to her!1”</p>
        <p>“No I do!” shouted.</p>
        <p>“No she doesn’t fucking like u, you son of a bitch!” yelled Draco.</p>
        <p>“No fuck you motherfucker she laves me not you!” shouted Vampire. And then……………… he jumped on Draco! <span role="note">(no not in dat way u perv)</span> They started to fight and beat up each other.</p>
        <p>Dumbldore yelled at them but they didn’t stop. All of a sudden…… a terrible man with red eyes and no nose flew in on his broomstick. He had no nose and was wearing a gray robe. All the glass in the window he flew thru fell apart. Britney that fucking prep started to cry. Vampire and Draco stopped fighting….I shopped eating….Everyone gasped. Da room fell silent………………….Volzemort!</p>
        <p>“Eboby…..Ebony…….” Darth Valer sed evilly in his raspy voice. “Thou havfe failed ur mission. Now I shall kill thou and I shall kill Vampire as well. If thou does not kill him before then I shall kill Draco too!”</p>
        <p>“Plz don’t make me kill him plz!” I begged.</p>
        <p>“No!” he laughed crudely. “Kill him, or I shall kill him anyway!” Then he flew away cackling.</p>
        <p>I bust into tears. Draco and Vampire came to contort me. Suddenly my eyes rolled up so they looked all cool and gothic. I had a vision were I saw some lighting flash and then Voldremot coming to kill Draco while Draco slit his wrists in a depressed way.</p>
        <p>“No!” I screamed sexily. Suddenly I locked up and stopped having the vision.</p>
        <p>“Ebony Ebony aure you alright?” asked Draco in a worried voice.</p>
        <p>“Yeah yeah.” I said sadly as I got up.</p>
        <p>“Everyfing’s all right Enoby.” said Vampire all sensetive.</p>
        <p>“No its not!” I shouted angrily. Tearz of blood went down my face. “<abbr title="Oh my fucking God">OMFG</abbr> what if I’m getting possessed like in Da Ring 2!”</p>
        <p>“Its ok gurl.” said B’loody Mary. “Maybe u should ask Proffesor Sinister about what the visions mean though.”</p>
        <p>“Ok bich.” I said sadly and den we went.</p>
