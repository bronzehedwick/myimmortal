        <p>The next day I woke up in my bedroom. It was snowing and raining again. I opened the door of my coffin and drank some blood from a bottle I had. My coffin was black ebony and inside it was hot pink velvet with black lace on the ends. I got out of my coffin and took of my giant <abbr title="My Chemical Romance">MCR</abbr> t-shirt which I used for pajamas. Instead, I put on a black leather dress, a pentagram necklace, combat boots and black fishnets on. I put on four pairs of earrings in my pierced ears, and put my hair in a kind of messy bun.</p>
        <p>My friend, Willow (<abbr title="Author's note">AN</abbr>: Raven dis is u!) woke up then and grinned at me. She flipped her long waist-length raven black hair with pink streaks and opened her forest-green eyes. She put on her Marilyn Manson t-shirt with a black mini, fishnets and pointy high-heeled boots. We put on our makeup (black lipstick white foundation and black eyeliner.)</p>
        <p>‟OMFG, I saw you talking to Draco Malfoy yesterday!” she said excitedly.</p>
        <p>‟Yeah? So?” I said, blushing.</p>
        <p>‟Do you like Draco?” she asked as we went out of the Slytherin common room and into the Great Hall.</p>
        <p>‟No I so fucking don’t!” I shouted.</p>
        <p>‟Yeah right!” she exclaimed. Just then, Draco walked up to me.</p>
        <p>‟Hi.” he said.</p>
        <p>‟Hi.” I replied flirtily.</p>
        <p>‟Guess what.” he said.</p>
        <p>‟What?” I asked.</p>
        <p>‟Well, Good Charlotte are having a concert in Hogsmeade.” he told me.</p>
        <p>‟Oh. My. Fucking. God!” I screamed. I love <abbr title="Good Charlotte">GC</abbr>. They are my favorite band, besides <abbr title="My Chemical Romance">MCR</abbr>.</p>
        <p>‟Well…. do you want to go with me?” he asked.</p>
        <p>I gasped.</p>
