        <p>Vampire and I ran up the stairs looking for Dumbledore. We were so scared.</p>
        <p>“Dumbledore Dumblydore!” we both yelled. Dumbledore came there.</p>
        <p>“What is it that you want now you despicable snobs?” he asked angrily.</p>
        <p>“Volsemort has Draco!” we shouted at the same time.</p>
        <p>He laughed in an evil voice.</p>
        <p>“No! Don’t! We need to save Draco!” we begged.</p>
        <p>“No.” he said meanly. “I don’t give a darn what Voldemort does to Draco. Not after how much he misbehaved in school especially with YOU Ebony.” he said while he frowned looking at me. “Besides I never liked him that much anyway.” then he walked away. Vampire started crying. “My Draco!” he moaned. <span role="note">(<abbr title="Author's note">AN</abbr>: don’t u fik gay guyz r lik so hot!)</span></p>
        <p>“Its okay!” I tried to tell him but that didn’t stop him. He started to cry tears of blood. Then he had a brainstorm. “I had an idea!” he exclaimed.</p>
        <p>“What?” I asked him.</p>
        <p>“You’ll see.” he said. He took out his wand and did a spell. Then…… suddenly we were in Voldemprt’s lair!</p>
        <p>We ran in with our wands out just as we heard a croon voice say. “Allah Kedavra!”</p>
        <p>It was……………………………….. Voldemort!</p>
